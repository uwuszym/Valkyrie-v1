   cd Valkyrie
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Create a `.env` file in the root and make the environment variables.

   ```bash
   npm run create-admin
   ```

5. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

~~Valkyrie can be deployed using Vercel. Ensure that environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard.~~

We migrated to a new hosting provider, so the site is now deployed on a private server. You can use whichever provider you want as long as they support nodejs.

## Asset Hosting

To save stuff like .rbxl files, thumbnails, images, etc, you can use AWS S3 Buckets.

1. **Create an S3 bucket** in your AWS account.

2. **Configure your bucket** to let public access if needed

3. **Add your AWS credentials** to the `.env` file

## Database

We use MongoDB Atlas for the DB. Don't know how reliable it is, but it's what we have for now and it's free. Plan to migrate to a self-hosted solution in the future.

## note to self
mrbobbilly keep updating this readme as we add more stuff so we can have documentation for the future
